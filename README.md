# Java_Dijkstra_Heap
Dijkstra's Algorithm over a heap, with graph stored in adjacency list of linked lists 

Takes in # of Nodes and Edges, then one edge per line (start node, end node, weight), then start and destination nodes 

Nodes Edges 
node node weight 
node node weight 
...
source destination 

Will return the length of the shortest path from source node to destination node.
